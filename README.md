## **About Just A Job App (JAJA)**

**JAJA tracks your job applications automatically, no spreadsheet required.** 

Isn't tracking companies you've applied to exhausting? The emotional toll burned me out faster than the job hunt itself.

That's why I built JAJA—to automate the tedious work of tracking applications.

##  🏗 **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Integrations:** Gmail API, Posthog

## 🛠 **Developer Mode**

The app includes a built-in developer mode that allows you to:
- **Toggle between real and mock Gmail API** using the UI
- **Test with realistic demo emails** without hitting real APIs
- **Add custom test emails** for development and testing
- **Full application flow** - everything works exactly like the real app

Perfect for:
- 🎥 **Live demos** - no real email data exposed
- 🧪 **Testing** - consistent test data
- 🔧 **Development** - no need for real Gmail credentials
- 📚 **Learning** - see how the app works with sample data

See [DEMO_MODE_README.md](DEMO_MODE_README.md) for detailed documentation.

## 🔒 **Privacy & Security**

- In closed beta (limit 100 users)
- GitHub code scanning active
- Gmail integration will undergo OAuth verification
- Found a vulnerability? Email security@justajobapp.com

## 📢 **A note from the maintainer**

- Just a Job App is open source. Fork it, remix it, or carry it on if I ever disappear to open a cat café. 🐾
- FYI, our sustainability model is still evolving. The goal is to keep it free for jobseekers, forever.
- Later on, we may introduce an enterprise offering to support that mission.
